Welcome to my **neovim** config folder

Through out the years (4 years) of using Neovim, I have came up with a very large neovim configuration. But now I drop most of them. This rewrite will be all in Lua. I prefer the S-expression syntax over Lua syntax, so I use Fennel with aniseed.

Now that neovim has 0.5 released, I changed the config to use its LSP and some nightly tree-sitter.

## Code environment

- C/C++/ObjC/ObjC++
- Python 3
- Golang
- Rust
- Scala
- Javascript (NodeJS, Deno)

- Java/Kotlin
- Haskell
- Ocaml with Coq
